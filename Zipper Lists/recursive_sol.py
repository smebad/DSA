# zipper lists
# Write a function, zipper_lists, that takes in the head of two linked lists as arguments. The function should zipper the two lists together into single linked list by alternating nodes. If one of the linked lists is longer than the other, the resulting list should terminate with the remaining nodes. The function should return the head of the zippered linked list.

# Do this in-place, by mutating the original Nodes.

# You may assume that both input lists are non-empty.


# Recursive Solution

class Node:
   def __init__(self, val):
     self.val = val
     self.next = None

    return None
  if head_1 is None:

  if head_2 is None:
    return head_1
  next_1 = head_1.next
  next_2 = head_2.next
  head_1.next = head_2
  head_2.next = zipper_lists(next_1, next_2)
