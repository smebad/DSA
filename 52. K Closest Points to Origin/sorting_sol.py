# K Closest Points to Origin
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

 

# Example 1:


# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
# Example 2:

# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
# Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
# -104 <= xi, yi <= 104


# Sorting solution:
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[0]**2 + p[1]**2)
        return points[:k]
    
# Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of points. This is because we sort the points based on their distance from the origin. 
# Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n) depending on the sorting algorithm used. In Python, the built-in sort function uses Timsort which has a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case.
# This solution is efficient and works well within the constraints given (1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4).


# Test Cases:
# Test Case 1:
points = [[1,3],[-2,2]]
k = 1
print(Solution().kClosest(points, k))  # Output: [[-2,2]]

# Test Case 2:
points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]]
k = 2
print(Solution().kClosest(points, k))  # Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
