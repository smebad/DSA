# Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
# Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

# Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

 

# Example 1:



# Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
# Root Node (3) is always a good node.
# Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
# Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
# Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
# Example 2:



# Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Root is considered as good.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
# Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once.
# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the tree, which can occur in the queue during BFS.
# This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and count the good nodes. And it maintains a queue to explore each node level by level, checking if the current node is a good node based on the maximum value seen so far in the path from the root to that node.
# However, the depth-first search (DFS) solution is more efficient in terms of space complexity, as it uses recursion and does not require an additional queue structure.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
