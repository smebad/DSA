# Kth Largest Element in a Stream
# You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

# You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

# Implement the KthLargest class:

# KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
# int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.
 

# Example 1:

# Input:
# ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
# [[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]

# Output: [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]

# Explanation:

# KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
# kthLargest.add(3); // return 4
# kthLargest.add(5); // return 5
# kthLargest.add(10); // return 5
# kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
# kthLargest.add(4); // return 8

# Example 2:

# Input:
# ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
# [[4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]], [2], [10], [9], [9]]

# Output: [null, 7, 7, 7, 8]

# Explanation:

# KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]);
# kthLargest.add(2); // return 7
# kthLargest.add(10); // return 7
# kthLargest.add(9); // return 7
# kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= nums.length <= 104
# 1 <= k <= nums.length + 1
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# -104 <= val <= 104
# At most 104 calls will be made to add.


# Sorting Solution:
from typing import List

class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.arr = nums

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        self.arr.append(val)
        self.arr.sort()
        return self.arr[len(self.arr) - self.k]
    

# Time Complexity: O(m * n log n) where m is the number of calls to add and n is the size of the array. This is because we sort the array every time we add a new element.
# Space Complexity: O(m) where m is the number of calls to add. O(1) or O(n) if we consider the space used by the input array, but since we are not using any additional data structures, we can consider it O(1) in terms of auxiliary space.
# This solution is less efficient but easier to implement than the min-heap solution, especially for large inputs, as it requires sorting the entire array every time a new element is added.
# However, it is straightforward and works well for small datasets or when the number of elements is manageable.


# Test Cases:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    kthLargest = KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2])
    print(kthLargest.add(3))  # Output: 4
    print(kthLargest.add(5))  # Output: 5
    print(kthLargest.add(10)) # Output: 5
    print(kthLargest.add(9))  # Output: 8
    print(kthLargest.add(4))  # Output: 8

    kthLargest2 = KthLargest(4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3])
    print(kthLargest2.add(2))  # Output: 7
    print(kthLargest2.add(10)) # Output: 7
    print(kthLargest2.add(9))  # Output: 7
    print(kthLargest2.add(9))  # Output: 8
