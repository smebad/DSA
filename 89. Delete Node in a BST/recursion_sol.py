# Delete Node in a BST
# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

# Search for a node to remove.
# If the node is found, delete the node.
 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
# Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
# Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [], key = 0
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# -105 <= Node.val <= 105
# Each node has a unique value.
# root is a valid binary search tree.
# -105 <= key <= 105
 

# Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?


# Recursive solution:
from typing import Optional
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return root

        if key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        elif key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        else:
            if not root.left:
                return root.right
            elif not root.right:
                return root.left

            cur = root.right
            while cur.left:
                cur = cur.left
            root.val = cur.val
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, root.val)

        return root
    
# Time Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is skewed, and we have to visit all nodes for each node.
# Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack.
# This recursive solution is optimal in terms of time and space complexity.


# Test Cases
# Test Case 1:
root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(6)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.right = TreeNode(7)
key = 3
print(Solution().deleteNode(root, key))  # Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]

# Test Case 2:
root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(6)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.right = TreeNode(7)
key = 0
print(Solution().deleteNode(root, key))  # Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]

# Test Case 3:
root = None
key = 0
print(Solution().deleteNode(root, key))  # Output: []
