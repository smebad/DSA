# Reverse String
# Two Pointers Solution:

from typing import List
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1

# Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is because we need to iterate through the string once to reverse it.
# Space Complexity: O(1) this is because we are using only a constant amount of space for the pointers l and r.
#  This two pointers solution is efficient for large inputs as it has a time complexity of O(n). It is optimal and works well for the problem.


# Test Cases:
# Test Case 1
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Solution().reverseString(s)
print(s) # Expected Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

# Test Case 2
s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Solution().reverseString(s)
print(s) # Expected Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
