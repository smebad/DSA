# Repeated DNA Sequences
# The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

# For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
# When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

# Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
# Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
# Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

# Hash Map Solution:
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        if len(s) < 10:
            return []

        mp = defaultdict(int)
        res = []
        for l in range(len(s) - 9):
            cur = s[l: l + 10]
            mp[cur] += 1
            if mp[cur] == 2:
                res.append(cur)

        return res


# Test Cases:
sol = Solution()

# Test Case 1:
s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
print(sol.findRepeatedDnaSequences(s))  # Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

# Test Case 2:
s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
print(sol.findRepeatedDnaSequences(s))  # Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
