# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

# Example 3:
# Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
# -109 <= Node.val <= 109
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# p and q will exist in the BST.



# Recursive solution:
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root or not p or not q:
            return None
        if (max(p.val, q.val) < root.val):
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        elif (min(p.val, q.val) > root.val):
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        else:
            return root
            

# Time complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is because we are traversing the tree from the root to the lowest common ancestor, which takes O(h) time in the worst case.
# Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is because we are using recursion, which adds to the call stack. In the worst case, the height of the tree can be equal to the number of nodes in the tree, leading to O(n) space complexity.
# This recursive solution is efficient and works well for large binary search trees.
# The recursive approach is more elegant and easier to understand, but it may not be as efficient in terms of space complexity compared to the iterative approach.
