# Implement Queue using Stacks
# Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

# Implement the MyQueue class:

# void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
# int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
# int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
# boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
# Notes:

# You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
 

# Example 1:

# Input
# ["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
# [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
# Output
# [null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

# Explanation
# MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
# myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
# myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
# myQueue.peek(); // return 1
# myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
# myQueue.empty(); // return false
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= x <= 9
# At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
# All the calls to pop and peek are valid.
 

# Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.


# Two Stacks Solution:
class MyQueue:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.s1 = []
        self.s2 = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.s1.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        if not self.s2:
            while self.s1:
                self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())
        return self.s2.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.s2:
            while self.s1:
                self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())
        return self.s2[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return max(len(self.s1), len(self.s2)) == 0
    
# Time Complexity: O(1) for push, O(n) for pop and peek in the worst case when s2 is empty, O(1) for empty. This is because we may need to transfer all elements from s1 to s2. The amortized time complexity for pop and peek is O(1) since each element is moved between the stacks at most once.
# Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the queue, as we are using two stacks to store the elements.
# This solution uses two stacks to simulate the behavior of a queue, ensuring that the first element pushed is the first one popped, maintaining FIFO order. And it efficiently handles the operations by transferring elements between the stacks only when necessary, achieving amortized O(1) time complexity for pop and peek operations.


# Test Cases
# Test Case 1:
myQueue = MyQueue()
myQueue.push(1)  # Queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2)  # Queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
print(myQueue.peek())  # return 1
print(myQueue.pop())  # return 1, queue is [2]
print(myQueue.empty())  # return false

# Test Case 2:
myQueue = MyQueue()
print(myQueue.empty())  # return true
