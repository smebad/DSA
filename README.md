# Data Structures and Algorithms Journey 🚀

## Overview 📚
Welcome to my journey of learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**! This repository serves as a collection of my notes, practice problems, solutions, and concepts related to DSA. My goal is to master the fundamental building blocks of computer science and improve my problem-solving skills. 💡

---

## Learning Goals 🎯
- Understand and implement various **data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables).
- Master essential **algorithms** (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph traversal techniques).
- Improve my problem-solving skills and coding efficiency through regular practice and challenges. 💪

---

## Repository Structure 📂
- **DSA Practice**: Problem solutions and coding challenges.
- **Concept Notes**: Detailed explanations of each topic using comments (#) and Readme files.
- **Resources**: Will be learning from different youtube tutorials, courses, and other helpful learning materials.
